# Bus-Tracking-System
It was a team project. I worked majorly on SQL and contributed on the backend part.
Built a real-time hand gesture recognition system using Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and MediaPipe. It processes live video to detect hand landmarks and classify gestures with a trained model, enabling intuitive, touchless interaction and delivering immediate visual feedback for recognized commands.
